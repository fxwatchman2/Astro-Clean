# AstroCharts Cascade Session Summary

This file summarizes the key technical and project context from your recent Cascade session. Use this to quickly bring Cascade up to speed after a restart or environment reset.

## Key Backend Changes
- **Renamed `CandleData` to `RowRecord`**: All references and files updated. Now used as the model for candle/row data.
- **Added `SharedCacheService`**: Singleton Spring `@Service` providing a thread-safe in-memory cache, accessible to multiple services/controllers.
- **`SymbolController`**: Injects `SharedCacheService` via constructor. Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/symbols` returns `["AAPL", "GOOGL"]`
  - `GET /api/symbols/{symbol}/candles` returns demo data as `List<RowRecord>`

## Frontend Key Points
- **Chart uses `lightweight-charts`** (not TradingView widget).
- Chart logo removed using `{ layout: { attributionLogo: false } }` in chart options.
- Chart data is currently hardcoded in `ChartComponent`, but should be wired to the backend REST endpoint for real data.

## Recent Progress (May 31, 2025)

### Backend
- Fixed package and import issues for `TickerList` and `Commons`.
- Restored and implemented `TickerList` with file reading and symbol extraction logic.
- Ensured backend builds cleanly with `mvn clean package spring-boot:repackage`.
- Backend now produces a runnable JAR and starts on port 8080.
- Added debug print for ticker list size in `Commons.getTickerList()`.
- Confirmed `/api/symbols` and `/api/getSymbolList` return dynamic lists from file.

### Frontend
- Ensured React app builds and runs with `npm start`.
- Fixed symbol list scroll bug: removed forced scrollbars, now fits parent container.
- Limited chart and symbol list to screen size (`100vw`, `100vh`, no scrollbars).
- Added a search box above the symbol list for real-time filtering.
- Fixed crash (missing `search` state) in `SymbolList.js`.

### Git & Repo Hygiene
- Added `.gitignore` to frontend to ignore `node_modules`, `build`, etc.
- Explained how to remove binaries from GitHub repo and keep only source files.
- Clarified difference between local folder and remote repo; deleting repo does not delete local files.

### Workflow Improvements
- Provided commands for clean backend build, frontend start, and repo cleanup.
- Documented how to safely reset or recreate the repo for a clean start.

## Outstanding Issues / Next Steps
- Backend build is failing due to `JAVA_HOME` not being recognized by the build process, despite being set in user/system variables. Likely requires IDE or system restart.
- After restart, verify backend build and integration with frontend.
- Next: Wire frontend chart to backend REST endpoint for live data.

## How to Use This File
- Show this file to Cascade after a restart to quickly restore context.
- Update with new architectural or design decisions as the project evolves.
